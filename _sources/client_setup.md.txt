# Project AirSim Client Setup

## Python Client

A Python client uses the following to communicate with the Project AirSim simulation server:

- Python 3.7 or newer, 64-bit
- **[pynng](https://github.com/codypiersall/pynng)** nanomsg-next-gen wrapper pip package

### Setting Up the Client on **Windows**

1. Install Python 3.7 or newer for Windows. There are many options for installing Python, but one recommended way is to:

    - Download the official **[Windows installer for Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)**.  Please note that the 64-bit version is required.

    - Install using these **custom** options:
        - Install for all users
        - Install pip
        - Do not add Python to environment variables to prevent version conflicts (instead use virtual environments to manage Python paths and packages)
        - Precompile standard library

2. Activate the Python environment to use with Project AirSim.

    If you don't have a suitable Python environment yet, do the following. Use the version and directory of your installation of Python:

    A) Install `virtualenv` and create a new environment (here named `airsim-venv` but you may choose any convenient name):

        python -m pip install virtualenv
        python -m venv C:\path\to\airsim-venv

    B) Activate your environment:

        C:\path\to\airsim-venv\Scripts\activate

    C) Verify the version of Python in your environment.

    Run this command:

        python --version

    to display the version of Python.

    Run the "python" command to enter the Python console and enter the following:

        import struct
        print(struct.calcsize("P") * 8)

    A 64-bit build of Python will print "64" while a 32-bit build of Python will print "32".

    If the environment is using a wrong version or the 32-bit build of Python, you'll need to exit the environment, delete the environment, and return to step A to recreate the environment with the correct version of Python.  If the installed Python is 32-bit, you'll also need to uninstall the 32-bit build and install the 64-bit build instead.

    D) Install basic tools for setting up other pip packages in the activated environment:

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install setuptools wheel
    
    Developers must also install the cmake package:
        python -m pip install cmake

3. Install the Project AirSim Python client library:

        cd path\to\repo
        python -m pip install -e client\python\projectairsim

    The base client install does not include Open3D. To use the LIDAR visualization
    utilities such as `LidarDisplay` and the LIDAR example scripts, install the
    optional `lidar` extra:

        python -m pip install -e client\python\projectairsim[lidar]

    If Open3D cannot be installed, your environment is most likely using a 32-bit
    build or a Python version that Open3D does not publish packages for. Rebuild
    the virtual environment (see step 2A) using a supported 64-bit version of
    Python, or install Open3D separately through a package manager such as conda.

### Setting Up the Client on **Linux**

1. Install Python 3.7 or newer to your system:

    Ubuntu 20.04 comes with Python 3.8, while newer versions like Ubuntu 24.04 come with Python 3.12:

        sudo apt install python3-dev python3-venv

    *Note: In Ubuntu 20.04, the system-installed Python (v3.8) can be launched by running `python3` instead of `python3.8`.*

2. Activate the Python environment to use with Project AirSim.

    If you don't have a suitable Python environment yet, do the following:

    A) Create a new `virtualenv` environment (here named `airsim-venv` but you may choose any convenient name):

        python3 -m venv /path/to/airsim-venv

    B) Activate your environment:

        source /path/to/airsim-venv/bin/activate

    C) Verify the version of Python in your environment.

    Run this command:

        python --version

    to display the version of Python.

    Run the "python" command to enter the Python console and enter the following:

        import struct
        print(struct.calcsize("P") * 8)

    A 64-bit build of Python will print "64" while a 32-bit build of Python will print "32".

    If the environment is using the wrong version or the 32-bit build of Python, you'll need to exit the environment, delete the environment, and return to step A) to recreate the environment with the correct version of Python.  If the installed Python is 32-bit, you'll also need to uninstall the 32-bit build and install the 64-bit build instead.

    D) Install basic tools for setting up other pip packages in the activated environment:

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install setuptools wheel

    Developers must also install the cmake package:
            python -m pip install cmake

3. Install the Project AirSim Python client library:

        cd path\to\repo
        python -m pip install -e client\python\projectairsim

    The base client install does not include Open3D. To use the LIDAR visualization
    utilities such as `LidarDisplay` and the LIDAR example scripts, install the
    optional `lidar` extra:

        python -m pip install -e client/python/projectairsim[lidar]

    If Open3D cannot be installed, your environment is most likely using a 32-bit
    build or a Python version that Open3D does not publish packages for. Rebuild
    the virtual environment (see step 2A) using a supported 64-bit version of
    Python, or install Open3D separately through a package manager such as conda.

### Checking Client Operation

After installation, you can check if the client works by launching Project AirSim and running one of the client demo scripts such as `hello_drone.py` with the Project AirSim Python environment activated:

```
<from activated Python environment with Project AirSim running>

python hello_drone.py
```

In your own custom client scripts, just import the client for your robot type (ex. Drone) from the Project AirSim Python client library:

``` python
from projectairsim import ProjectAirSimClient, Drone, World
```

For more details about using the client to connect, send/receive signals, etc, see the `hello_drone.py` example script contents or the specific **[API documentation](api.md)** for your simulation scenario.

## C++ Client

Project AirSim also includes a native C++17 client under `client/cpp/`.

The C++ client uses the following to communicate with the Project AirSim
simulation server:

- A C++17 compiler
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- NNG-based transport through the `NNGI` wrapper
- The `ProjectAirSimMessageLib` message serialization library
- The high-level `ProjectAirsimClient` API library

Build the C++ client from the repository root:

```bash
./build.sh cpp_client_debug
./build.sh cpp_client_release
```

On Windows:

```bat
build.cmd cpp_client_debug
build.cmd cpp_client_release
```

Compiled Linux libraries and example binaries are placed in:

```text
client/cpp/build_linux/Debug/
client/cpp/build_linux/Release/
```

Windows library artifacts are placed in:

```text
client\cpp\libraries\x64\Debug\
client\cpp\libraries\x64\Release\
```

For setup details, binary locations, and usage examples, see
**[Project AirSim C++ Client](cpp_client.md)**.
